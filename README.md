# QTIPoC-phrases-typing-game
<br/>
An educational typing game that helps you learn phrases related to the QTIPoc(Queer, Trans, Intersex, People of Colour) community and also give your typing speed and average typing speed of all the phrases you've typed.



## Inspiration
I am a black, queer person and my communities are marginalised and underrepresented especially in the tech industry. This leads to a lot of stereotyping and general misconceptions about who we are and often we are seen as a monolith. I hoping that by making this game it exposes people to the multitudes our communities contain and peaks their curiousity to learn more and ask questions about different types of people that exist in this world.
